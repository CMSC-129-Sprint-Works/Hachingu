Korean is written into "blocks" that make up one syllable, so a block is always exactly one syllable. These blocks can be drawn in one of 4 ways.

**Important Rules**
* **2** is *always* a vowel
* **1**,**3**,(sometimes **4**) are *always* consonants
* Blocks containing a horizontally drawn vowel are always drawn in the form **a** or **b**
* Blocks containing a vertically drawn vowel are always drawn in the form **c** or **d**

Now it's just a matter of combining consonants and vowels to form a syllable or block. Say, we want to write 'hip.' Here are the steps to writing it:

1. Determine if the vowel is vertically or horizontally drawn. In this case, *i* is vertically drawn
2. Determine if the syllable ends in a consonant. In this case, it does so we follow the **d** form
3. Fill in the corresponding letters into the spaces.
