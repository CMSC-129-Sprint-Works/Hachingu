Did you know that there are fewer Korean characters than there are letters in the English alphabet? Even their most complex one takes just five strokes. So, don't worry too much and take these basics to heart.

Just like English, Korean is read from left to right, top to bottom.

This example is the Korean equivalent of "hello." It is pronounced *an-nyeong-ha-sae-yo* when read correctly.

There are 10 vowels and 14 consonants in the Korean language. There are actually more complex letters but let's stick to the simple ones for now.

# Consonants

Let’s focus on consonants first. In Korean, there are no F, R, V, and Z sounds. Q, W, and X can be made by combining two or more sounds (kw, ks) and Y cannot stand alone and must be followed by a vowel sound. C and K can be grouped together, leaving us with a smaller consonant count of 12

B, C/K, D, G, H, J, L, M, N, P, S, T

Based on where the consonant is placed in a syllable (beginning, middle, or end), the sound changes.

# Vowels

There are ten vowels.

*Vertically drawn vowels*
ㅣ = i (ee), tall like a tree
ㅏ = a (ah)
ㅑ = ya
ㅓ = eo (Romanized as “eo” but it sounds closer to “uh” in English)
ㅕ = yeo

*Horizontally drawn vowels*
ㅡ = eu, long like a brook
ㅜ = u (oo)
ㅠ = yu 
ㅗ = o (oh)
ㅛ = yo

There are 11 complex vowels made up from basic letters
ㅐ = ae
ㅒ = yae
ㅔ = e
ㅖ = ye
ㅘ = wa
ㅙ = wae
ㅚ = oe
ㅝ = wo
ㅞ = we
