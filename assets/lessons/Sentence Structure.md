# Pronouns
Just like the English language, Korean makes use of pronouns to shorten sentences and refer to people or objects. Be aware that some of these pronouns change based on the level of respect. We will discuss honorifics in the next lessons.

Here are the following pronouns. For now, it is best to memorize them for we will use them in future examples.

나 - I (informal)
저 - I (formal)
너 - you (informal)
그 - that/him/they 
저 - that/him/they
이 - this
그녀 - she/her (informal)
우리 - us


# Sentence Word Order
Korean’s sentence structure follows the following sequences:

**Subject-Object-Verb (SOV)** sequence, 
**Subject-Adjective (SA)** sequence, and
**Subject-Noun(SN)** sequence

for example, 
I eat the apple - I apple eat
I go to school - I school go

I am handsome - I handsome
I am happy - I happy

I am a student - I student
She is a girl - She girl

Korean sentences can end with a Verb, Adjective, or Noun.

# Particles
Korean words have particles attached to them that is used to tag certain words as subjects or objects. These particles are what makes the language a little bit more convenient over the English language. 

**는/은 - Subject**
The **는 or 은** particle is attached to the **Subject** of the sentence.

는 is used when the last letter of the subject is a vowel, for instance

나는 - I
여자는 - The girl


은 is used when the last letter of the subject is a consonant

학생은 - The student
선생님은 - The teacher

**를/을 - Object**
The **를 or 을** particle is attached to the **Object** of the sentence.

를 is used when the last letter of the object is a vowel, for instance

사과를 - apple
여자를 - woman


을 is used when the last letter of the object is a consonant

집을 - house
물을 - water

We can now create simple sentences.

I study Korean - I는 Korean를 study
는/은 is attached to "I"(the subject)
를/을 is attached to "Korean" (the object)

나는 한국어를 공부하다 - I study korean.

I drink water - I는 water를 drink
는/은 is attached to "I"(the subject)
를/을 is attached to "water"(the object)

나는 물을 마시다 - I drink water

For sentences with adjectives, we can attach the particle to the subject..

I am happy - I는 happy
는/은 is attached to "I"(the subject)

나는 행복하다 - I am happy

Nayeon is pretty - Nayeon는 pretty
는/은 is attached to "Nayeon"(the subject)
나연은 예쁘다 - Nayeon is pretty

Mina is smart - Mina는 smart
는/은 is attached to "Mina"(the subject)

미나는 똑똑하다 - Mina is smart


# To be - (noun)이다
Korean has one grammatical principle that describes a subject is another entity/object, and that is 이다. English is complicated as it has a ton of words used for this relationship. For instance

I ++am++ a student
She ++is++ a teacher
You ++are++ a friend

All these underlined words signify that the subject is some form/classified as the noun in the sentence.
In korean 이다 can be used to represent this "to be" meaning. 이다 is attached directly to the end of the noun. For example

나는 학생이다 - I am a student
그녀는 선생님이다 - She is a teacher
너는 친구이다 - You are a friend


# This, That - 이/저/그
The usage of 이/그/저 in korean is very similar to its English usage. 

이 - this
저 - that
그 - that

Like in English, they are put before the noun to signify this/that object or thing.

이 것 - this thing
그 사람 - that person
저 사과 - that apple

We use 이 to refer to a physical thing within reach.

이 사과는 맛있다 - this apple is delicious(while you are holding the apple)

이 여자는 여뻐요 - this girl is pretty(as Nayeon points to herself)


We use 저 to refer to a physical thing that you cannot reach

저 산은 장엄하다 - That mountain is magnificent(while looking at the mountain)
저 새는 크다- that birb is big(while pointing at the bird)

We use 그 to refer to something from the previous sentence or context

그 여자는 안 예쁘다 - That girl is not pretty. (As Nayeon gossips about Tzuyu)
** We will talk about the word 안 in the coming lessons, but it is simply equivalent to "not" in english
